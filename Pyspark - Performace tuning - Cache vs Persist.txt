1. Cache is a programming mechanism which gives option to store data in-memory across
	worker nodes.
	
2. Persist is a programming mechanism which gives option to store data either
	in-memory or in disc across nodes.
	
3. Mostly we do lazy evaluation and call action at the end.
	df1 = df.select(df.emp_name, df.doj, df.dob,df.status)
	df2 = df1.filter(df.status = "active")
	df3 = df2.withColumn("emp_age",current_date - df1.dob)
	df3.count() ##Calling action
	
4. Storage levels
	a. MEMORY_ONLY = Same as cache
	b. MEMORY_ONLY_SER = Persist RDD in serialized form. It is space efficient
						but not time efficient.
	c. MEMORY_AND_DISC = Store partitions on disk which doesnot fit in memory
	d. MEMORY_AND_DISC_SER = Same as above but serialized
	e. DISK_ONLY = Persist data in Disk which require input and output operations.
					Still better performance than re-evaluation each time through
					DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
	f. MEMORY_ONLY_2, MEMORY_ONLY_SER_2, MEMORY_AND_DISC_2, MEMORY_AND_DISC_SER_2,
		DISK_ONLY_2 = same as above methods but creates replication in another node.
						Helpful incase of failure.
		
5.	Memory only = High space Used and Low CPU Time
	DISK_ONLY = Low space used and High CPU time
