1. Two Types of partition strategies
	Repartition
	Coalesce
	
2. Right number of partitions created based on number of cores boosts the performance.
	If not, hits the performance.
	Evenly distributed partition, improves the performance.
	
3. Default partitions for RDD/Dataframe
	sc.defaultParallelism = 8 (8 partitions created by default)
	spark.conf.get("spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes") = 128 MB
	
4. a. Function Repartition is used to increase or decrease partitions in spark
   b. Repartition always shuffle the data and build new partitions from scratch.
   c. Repartition results in almost equal size partitions.
   d. Due to shuffling, performace can be affected in some use cases.
   
5. Repartition 
	Executor 1 : P1, P2, P3
	Executor 2 : P4, P5, P6
	
	df.repartition(4)  [shuffled data = P1+P2+P3+P4+P5+P6]
	
	Executor 1 : P1, P2
	Executor 2 : P3, P4
	
6. a. Coalesce function only reduces number of partitions.
   b. Coalesce doesn't require a full shuffle.
   c. Coalesce combine few partitions or shuffle data only from few partitions thus avoiding
		full shuffle
   d. Due to partition merge, it produces uneven size of partitions.
   e. Since full shuffle is avoided, coalesce is better performant than repartition.
   
7. Coalesce
	Executor 1 : P1, P2, P3
	Executor 2 : P4, P5, P6
	
	df.coalsce(4)
	
	Executor 1 : P1=P1+P3, P2
	Executor 2 : P3=P5+P6, P4
