	1. Spark is open source distributed computing engine. It is used for processing and analysing a large amount of data.
	2. It is 100 times faster in memory as compared to Hadoop.
	3. Spark has well designed layered architecture. It follows master/slave concept. There is a Driver, worker and cluster manager layer.

Spark Attributes
	1. Scalable
	2. Fault tolerant
	3. Polyglot (many languages follow)
	4. Speed
	5. Rich Libraries like ML, AI

Application can have job. A Job can have multiple Stages. Each Stage can have multiple tasks.

Terminologies
	1. Transformation -  Transform the input RDD(Resilient Distributed Dataset) and creates new RDD.
	2. DAG: Directed Acyclic Graph keeps track of all transformation. For each transformation, logical plan is created and lineage graph is maintained by DAG.
	3. Action: For storage purpose or when data output is needed.  Action executed based on DAG.
	4. RDD: Resilient Distributed Dataset is basic data structure of Spark.
	5. Executor: Each worker node consists of many executor.
	6. Partition: RDD/Dataframe is stored in-memory of cluster in form of partition
	7. Core: Each executor can consists of multiple cores.
	8. On-heap memory within JVM and Off-heap memory outside JVM managed by OS.

Memory Architecture
	1. Unified Memory = Store memory + Execution memory  and is 60% of heap memory
	2. User Memory = 40% of heap memory
	3. Reserved Memory ~ 300MB
