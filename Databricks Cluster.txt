DataBricks Cluster:
1. Cluster is computing infrastructure in databricks environment.
2. Cluster is the set of computation resources and configurations.

Cluster Types
1. All Purpose Cluster:
	These are used to execute and analyze data collaborately using interative notebooks. 
	We can manually terminate and restart these cluster.
	Multiple users can share it

2. Job Cluster:
	These are used to run fast and robust automated jobs.
	These are created at the start of the execution and terminate at the end of execution
	
3. Pools
	These are created to reduce boot time and autoscaling.
	Cluster can be attached to pool
	Pool is configured with set of idle and ready to use instances.
	When job is executed, cluster will return back to pool.
	
Cluster Modes
1. Standard: 
	For Single user with No Team Collaboration
	
2. High Concurrency: 
	This mode is suitable for collaboration.
	
3. Single Node:
	This mode run job only on driver mode and No worker node is provisioned.
	
Cluster Runtime
Runtime is the set of core components that are needed for cluster to run. It differs in usability(Data Science, Data Engg), performance and security.

Worker Node measurement is done in DBU (DataBricks Unit)
Spot instance saves money
