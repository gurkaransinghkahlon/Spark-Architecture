Pyspark - UDF
	UDF - User Defined Function is a piece of Code which performs certain tasks
			and can be reused to perform the same task across multiple 
			scenarios.
	
	import pyspark.sql.functions as f
	def udf_name(parameters):
		--Code
		return output
		
	Notes:
	1. UDF is expensive operation in spark development.
	2. Try to minimise the usage of UDF and apply built in functions wherever possible
	3. UDF are created in python or scala and dataframe in JVM so UDF need
		serialization/deserialization to perform the task.
